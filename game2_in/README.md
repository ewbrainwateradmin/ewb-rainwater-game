# Water Shed

#### About the game
Water Shed is a game to promote awareness about the impact of our personal water footprint on the environment.   
It challenges players to make choices in their daily lives to lower their water footprint. We often don't realize   
that many items/choices could have hidden or unexpected water footprints.
